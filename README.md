## 📍 What is Ripely?

**Ripely** helps Academy Learners who enjoy eating fruits identify the ripeness of apples using **CreateML’s Image Classification** model integrated with **Vision**.

It classifies an object into one of four categories:

- 🍎 Ripe Apple (typically red)
- 🍏 Unripe Apple (typically green)
- 🤢 Rotten Apple (visibly damaged)
- ❌ Not an Apple

> 🧑‍💻 Built as part of a capstone project at **Apple Developer Academy @BINUS**, Ripely combines ML learning with practical daily relevance.

---

## 🎯 Why We Built This

Our objective:  
**Help identify the ripeness of apples for Academy Learners who enjoy eating fruits using CreateML’s Image Classification with Vision.**

Ripely serves as both an educational showcase and a fun, helpful tool for learners exploring machine learning on iOS.

---

## 🍽 Use Case Scenario

- 📱 Snap a photo of an apple in the cafeteria or kitchen
- ⚡ Instantly see its ripeness status via real-time prediction
- 🤖 Learn how image classification works behind the scenes
- 🍏 Avoid eating unripe or spoiled fruit!

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real-time prediction via camera  
- 📸 Manual image classification via photo picker  
- 🧠 CoreML model trained using **CreateML**  
- 🌈 Handles various lighting and backgrounds  
- 🎓 Ideal for educational demonstration of Vision + CoreML
